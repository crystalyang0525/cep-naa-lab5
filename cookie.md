Â½ cup shortening

4 cups confectioners' sugar

5 tablespoons milk, or more as needed

1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste

food coloring (Optional)

STEPS
Beat shortening in a large bowl until creamy. Gradually mix in 
confectioners' sugar in small amounts, alternating with 5 tablespoons 
milk, until smooth. Mix in vanilla and continue to beat until frosting is 
stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes, adding more milk if needed.

Mix in food coloring, separating into smaller bowls if using multiple 
colors.

Spread frosting on cookies or fill piping bags and decorate cookies as 
desired.
